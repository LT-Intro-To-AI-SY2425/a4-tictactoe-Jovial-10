# Assignment 4 - Writeup

In assignment 4 we created a basic tic tac toe game so that we could learn object oriented programming. Respond to the following questions.

## Reflection Questions

1. What was the most difficult part to tic-tac-toe?

Writing the actual logic behind the code and making sure that every condition that needs to be met for the program to work was met. 

2. Explain how you would add a computer player to the game.

Adding a function that allows the computer to generate a random number to pick from the open spaces on the tic tac toe board.

3. If you add a computer player, explain (doesn't have to be super technical) how you might get the computer player to play the best move every time. *Note - I am not grading this for a correct answer, I just want to know your thoughts on how you might accomplish it.

I would add a program to make sure that the computer analyzes every possible outcome to doing a move and also accordingly analyze outcomes with the human player's move.
